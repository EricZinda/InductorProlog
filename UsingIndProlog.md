The Inductor Prolog engine supports only what was required to ship the [Exospecies](www.exospecies.com) game.

- Because this was designed as a runtime Prolog engine and not an interactive compiler, any kind of "program error" that would normally be returned as a compile or runtime error to the user instead aborts the process. The error is printed out to the debug output of your system, however.
