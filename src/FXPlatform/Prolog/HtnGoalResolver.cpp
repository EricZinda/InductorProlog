// Basic model: We are exploring a tree. Every node of the tree represents a set of goals (resolvents). Every node of the tree takes one goal, and either:
//      - resolves it by replacing it with the tail end of a rule (which could simply be TRUE if it is a fact or arithmetic term) and creates a new node
//          - If the tail is empty (i.e. true), this is a solution
//      - or fails because there is no such thing to do, in which case no solutions are generated from that branch
//
// Implementation:
// This uses depth first search and no recursion (or at least not any unless built-in rules are used) to reduce memory (i.e. stack) usage
// Each "stack frame" represents a different binding of a rule to a goal, which means a set of resolvents which are equivalent to the stack above, but resolved
// by replacing the previous first resolvent with a rule in the database. Each stack frame is a new branch of the solution tree.
// If anything fails on this branch we backtrack all the way to the place where we branched and try the alternatives
// If we make it all the way to the point where there are no more resolvents to solve, then we push that solution into the list of solutions and keep going to return
// Returns nullptr if they can't be unified, otherwise returns a vector of all the solutions (which could be empty if they unified but no assignments were needed)

// We are unifying two terms which can have variables
// Required Expression Operations:
//      IsVariable: True if expression is solely a variable
//      does not occur: check if a variable occurs in a different expression
//      Substitute variable A for B in the stack and in answer
//          Means variables need to be able to point to other variables
//          This means that variables can contain expressions, so when we are traversing the expression tree, we have to *resolve*
//          those nodes first before looping.  Maybe it is just an overload of the children. Can't quite be that because it will be a level of indirection
// Unify: initialLeft and initialRight
// Output: Answer, which is always in the form Variable = Term
// There is a stack of left and right terms
// There is a substitution: answer which is empty
// Push initialLeft and initialRight
// while stack is not empty
//      Pop left and right from stack
//      if X is a variable that does not occur in Y: Sub Y for X in thestack and in Answer
